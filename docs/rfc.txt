RFC: RTYPE

1. Introduction
    This document describes the RTYPE networking protocol, designed for a
    multiplayer game. The system comprises a server and clients, with the
    server (r-type_server) managing the game state and clients (r-type_client)
    rendering the game world. The protocol facilitates communication between
    the server and clients over TCP and UDP sockets for efficient data
    transfer.

2. Terminology
    - Server: The central game server that manages the game state.
    - Client: A player's game client that connects to the server.
    - TCP: Transmission Control Protocol, a connection-oriented protocol.
    - UDP: User Datagram Protocol, a connectionless protocol.
    - Socket: A communication endpoint for sending and receiving data.
    - IP Address: A unique identifier for a device on a network.
    - Port Number: A number that identifies a specific process on a device.
    - Packet: A unit of data sent over a network.
    - Channel: A communication path between the server and clients.
    - Lua: A lightweight, high-level programming language used for scripting.

3. Protocol Overview
    The RTYPE protocol is designed to be lightweight and efficient for
    real-time multiplayer games. It operates over TCP and UDP sockets, with TCP
    used for reliable data transfer and UDP for real-time data. The protocol is
    designed to handle multiple concurrent connections.

3.1 Protocol Specification
    Every communication exchange between the server and clients will occur in
    this order:
        - Integer: represents the size of the packet.
        - Packet:
            - Integer: represents the size of the data.
            - Data: the actual data being sent.
                The data contains serialized string or/and an integer, so the
                data content is in binary. The data will be read in the same
                order it was written.
            - Integer: represents the type of the packet:
                - NONE = 0 (No action will be taken, this packet is ignored)
                - CONNECT = 1 (A new client is connecting to the server)
                - DISCONNECT = 2 (A client is disconnecting from the server)
                - NET = 3 (Message will be handled by the lua virtual machine)
                - NEW_MESSAGE = 4 (Create a new channel for the NET messages)

3.2. Handshake
    Clients establish a TCP connection to the server using the server's IP
    address and port number. The server listens for incoming connections and
    accepts new clients.

    The client sends a "CONNECT" packet to the server to initiate the
    connection. The server send a challenge key to the client, the client must
    respond with the correct answer to the challenge to be authenticated.
    If the client fails to respond with the correct answer, the server will
    close the connection.

    Then the server sends a "CONNECT" packet to the client to confirm the
    connection with the data being a single string that contains
    "AUTHENTICATED". The client will then send a "CONNECT" packet with no data
    to request available channels. The server will respond with all the
    available channels send in individual "NEW_MESSAGE" packets.

3.3 Data Transfer
    Once the connection is established, the server and client can exchange
    data. The server sends game state updates to the clients over UDP for
    real-time rendering. Clients can send input commands to the server over UDP
    to control their game characters. TCP is used for reliable data transfer,
    such as player login/logout messages.

4. Packet commands Specification
    4.1 NONE
        It is the default packet type, no action will be taken. Packet using
        this command will be ignored and discarded.

    4.2 CONNECT

    4.3 DISCONNECT

    4.4 NET
        The NET packet command is used to send messages between the server and
        clients and will be handled by the lua virtual machine. The start of
        the data is always a string that represents the name of the channel
        where the message will be sent.

    4.5 NEW_MESSAGE
        Only sent from server, the packet command "NEW_MESSAGE" indicates to
        create a new communication channel between client and server
        with a specific name. The new channel can be either TCP or UDP.
        The choice for the type of communication (TCP/UDP) is indicated
        by a boolean in the "data" sent in the packet.
        A channel is characterized by its name.

5. Channel
    In networking, a channel refers to a communication pathway that facilitates
    the transfer of data between devices.
    Differents type of communication characterized by differents protocols are
    used depending of the needs. The type of communication (TCP/UDP) is defined
    by the engine when the channel is created by “NEW_MESSAGE”.

5.1 Channel lifetime
    After the creation of a channel, it's not deleted until the end of the game.

5.2 TCP channel
    Transport Control Protocol (TCP) is connection-oriented and establishes a
    three-way handshake before data transfer. Packet architecture ensures
    delivery in the correct order.

5.3 UDP channel
    User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is connectionless and does not establish a
    connection before sending data. Does not guarantee delivery, order, or
    error checking.

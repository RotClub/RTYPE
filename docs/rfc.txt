RFC: RTYPE

1. Introduction
    This document describes the RTYPE networking protocol, designed for a multiplayer game.
    The system comprises a server and clients, with the server (r-type_server) managing the game state and clients (r-type_client) rendering the game world.
    The protocol facilitates communication between the server and clients over TCP and UDP sockets for efficient data transfer.

2. Terminology
    - Server: The central game server that manages the game state.
    - Client: A player's game client that connects to the server.
    - TCP: Transmission Control Protocol, a connection-oriented protocol.
    - UDP: User Datagram Protocol, a connectionless protocol.
    - Socket: A communication endpoint for sending and receiving data.

3. Protocol Overview
    The RTYPE protocol is designed to be lightweight and efficient for real-time multiplayer games.
    It operates over TCP and UDP sockets, with TCP used for reliable data transfer and UDP for real-time data.
    The protocol is designed to handle multiple concurrent connections.

3.1. Server-Client Connection Establishment
    Clients establish a TCP connection to the server using the server's IP address and port number.
    The server listens for incoming connections and accepts new clients.

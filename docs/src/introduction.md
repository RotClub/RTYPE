# Introduction

**R-TYPE** is a 2D side-scrolling shoot 'em up game. The player controls a spaceship that can move horizontally and vertically. The game is divided into several levels, each with a boss at the end. The player must defeat the boss to progress to the next level. The player can collect power-ups to upgrade their ship's weapons and shields. The player must avoid or destroy enemy ships and projectiles to survive.

## What we made

In the context of EPITECH, we had to implement this project with some added features.

- Fully fledged engine with a Node System
- Socket system with TCP and UDP
- LUAU Virtual Machine

The engine in itself makes 2 executables, a `server` and a `client`, the server on launch selects a game from a bunch of available games (either via launch arguments or selection if multiple games are available)
